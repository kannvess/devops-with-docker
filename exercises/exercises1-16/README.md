# Description

I deployed the app from the previous exercise (1.15) on Azure since my uni is a "partner" of Microsoft.

# Steps

- I created a Container App in Azure
- Filled out inputs relating to the image used as in:
  - Where is the image registry? (docker.io)
  - What's the tag of the image? (kannvess/exercises1-15)
  - Environment variables? (PORT=8080)
  - Ingress? (Yes, on port 8080)
  - And a bunch of non-container related stuff (mostly Azure and its shenanigans)
